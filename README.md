# Taska - The Oracle of Onchain Agent Activity

Taska is the first Proof-of-Task protocol that makes onchain agent actions transparent and verifiable through immutable execution receipts.

## The Problem

Autonomous onchain agents are rapidly emerging across DeFi, trading, and beyond, but they operate as black boxes:
- **No provable actions** - Agents can be ineffective, malicious, or impossible to train
- **Fragmented data** - Onchain data exists but is scattered and hard to interpret  
- **No quality metrics** - Users, protocols, and other agents can't measure execution success

Without transparency, the agent economy can't reach its full potential.

## The Solution: Proof-of-Task Protocol

Taska transforms opaque agent behavior into transparent, auditable data streams:

- **Immutable Receipts** - Every agent action posts a Proof-of-Task (PoT) with transaction details, parameters, and outcomes
- **Incentive Alignment** - Rewards trigger only after valid proof; bad actors get slashed for failed execution
- **Performance Analytics** - Enable training, ranking, and benchmarking of agent quality

## Bootstrap Applications

We're launching apps built on Taska protocol to prove value and drive adoption:

- **üöÄ Restake-Turbo** - Maximizes ETH/wstETH yields on Base (20% fee on extra yield)
- **üí∞ Cash-Back Swaps** - Refunds gas + MEV with transparent proofs (5% fee on refunds)  
- **üõ°Ô∏è Liquidation Shield** - Prevents loan liquidation with verifiable protection (10% fee on avoided penalties)
- **üîÑ Stablecoin Forex Swapper** - USD ‚Üî EURC arbitrage with guaranteed rates (0.5% total fees)

## Vision: Universal Trust Layer

**"Taska will be the universal trust layer for the autonomous economy."**

From DeFi yield bots today to robotics and IoT tomorrow, we make it easy for anyone to see, prove, and trust autonomous actions.

### Roadmap
- **Q4 2025** - Launch PoT-powered DeFi apps on Base
- **Q1-Q2 2026** - Expand application suite, third-party integrations  
- **H2 2026** - Taska AppChain for cheaper PoT batching
- **2027+** - Robotics & IoT integration, enterprise adoption

## Market Opportunity

- Capturing just **1% of staked ETH on Base** (~$700M) = **~$1.4M annual fees** from Restake-Turbo alone
- Expanding PoT data into agent performance analytics = **SaaS-style recurring revenue**
- First-mover advantage as the **"proof layer" for all agent-driven protocols**

## Repositories

- More protocol and application repositories coming soon...
